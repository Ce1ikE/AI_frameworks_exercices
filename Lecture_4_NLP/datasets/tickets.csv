2025/10/09 10:48:10 am EEST,Training dataset contains unsanitized personal contact details,"While performing a routine audit of customer_feedback_training_v4.csv I discovered multiple rows that still contain personally identifying information: full names, personal email addresses and several phone numbers in the contact_info column. The file was supposedly anonymized before ingestion into our feature store, but these rows appear to be original raw records that slipped through. I sampled 250 rows and found ~12 rows with obvious PII. This is a potential compliance risk if that dataset was used for any offline model training or shared across teams. Could someone (a) confirm whether a sanitized copy exists, (b) temporarily remove the public share link, and (c) advise whether we should trigger a re-training notification for models that used this dataset between Aug 10–Sep 02?",Privacy issue
