    "\n",
    "In search of an optimal solution for a given problem we will need to tweak the parameters of the neural network model. Knowing how to tweak the parameters and knowing to either increase or decrease a specific value, translates into math in finding a partial derivative of our model. This operation is the central part of backpropagation used within neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch has the **autograd** feature that helps in these calculations. It will allow to build flexible and fast machine learning projects. Autograd will allow the computation of multiple partial derivatives (also named *gradients*) of our complex model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The power of autograd comes from the fact that it traces your computation dynamically *at runtime,*. This means that if your model has decision branches, or loops whose lengths are unknown up to the moment the model will execute - or run - autograd will still trace these calculations correctly, and will calculate the correct gradients to drive the optimizations of the parameters of the model."

    "## A mathematical view on autograd\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a high-level mathematical helicopter view of our machine learning model and discuss it here as a *function*, with inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs are defined by an *i*-dimensional vector $\\vec x$, with elements $x_{i}$. You can see them as the input features. We can then express the model, *M*, as a vector-valued function of the input and it will in a general case result in a vector output: *$\\vec y$ = $\\vec M$($\\vec x$)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we'll be using autograd in the context of training, our output of interest will be the model's loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *loss function* *L($\\vec y$) = L($\\vec M$($\\vec x$))* is typically a **single-valued** scalar function of the model's output. This function expresses how far off our model's prediction was from a particular input's *true* output.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of *training* a model is thus to  minimize the loss by adjusting the parameters of our model. For a perfect model this will mean that we want to tweak the parameters of our model in such a way, that our loss function will result in a 0 outcome. With a zero loss we have a perfect model that gives our *true* outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In reality our data, both input and output, will have some noise and we will not always get *true* outputs. Also our model is always an approximation of reality but not reality itself and rounding errors in our calculations will have a further impact, resulting in a model that does not give *true* outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To guide the tuning of the parameters to minimize the loss, we need a mathematical tool to guide us in the good direction, meaning down the slope. This mathematical tool to *minimize* the loss is the first derivative which we'll need to equal to 0: $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = 0$. With the first derivative having a value of 0, we'll know that our model's parameters have been changed in such a way that we have reached a minimum. Depending on the loss-function, this minimum could then be global or a local minimum (if e.g. the loss-function is convex and is differentiable everywhere, then we know that when the gradient of the loss-function=0 then we have reached the global minimum).\n",
    "\n",
    "Mind that the loss is a function of the model's output and is not *directly* derived from the input. Off course the output is an *indirect* function of the input, through the model that is being applied to the input. "
